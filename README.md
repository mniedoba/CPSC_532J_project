# CPSC_532J_project
Code for the final project of CPSC 532J: Never Ending RL

Main training entry point for training SMC and Top-K algorithms is train_policy.py.

There is also some code for evaluating the inner SAC loop on policies pre-trained with SAC. That testing didn't make it into the final presentation.
